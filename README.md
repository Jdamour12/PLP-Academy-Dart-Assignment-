# PLP-Academy-Dart-Assignment

String Manipulation:

- I implemented a program that demonstrates string concatenation, interpolation, substring extraction, and case conversion (upper/lowercase).
- I added functionality to reverse a string and count its length.

Collections (Lists, Sets, Maps):

- I created a Dart program that demonstrates the use of lists, sets, and maps.
- I included operations like adding, removing, and iterating over items.
- I showcased scenarios where each collection type is most appropriate.

File Handling:

- I wrote a Dart program that reads content from a file and writes new data into another file.
- I demonstrated how to handle errors during file operations.

Date and Time:

- I developed a program that uses Dart's DateTime class.
- I formatted, parsed, and manipulated dates (e.g., add/subtract days).
- I calculated the difference between two dates.

Final:

- I combined the above utilities to build a small application. This application:
- I performed string manipulation on user input.
- I stored the results in a collection.
- I saved the data to a file.
- I used the date and time utilities to log when each entry was made.
